# Image Patches Generation

This repository provides code and Jupyter notebooks for generating image patches with overlapping regions. The code is written in Python and utilizes the `patchify` library, along with other image processing techniques, to extract patches from an input image.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Image
- OpenCV

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```shell
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-image opencv-python


Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-patches-generation.git

2. Open the Jupyter notebook generate_patches.ipynb to see an example of how to generate image patches with overlapping regions.

3. Customize the notebook according to your requirements, such as changing the patch size, step size, or threshold value.

4. Run the notebook to generate the image patches. The patches will be saved as separate image files in the specified folder.


Folder Structure

The repository has the following folder structure:

images/: Contains the input image(s) used for generating the patches.
image_patches/: Contains the generated image patches.
generate_patches.ipynb: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the patch generation process.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the repository.
